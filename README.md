### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dan, a self taught Fullstack Web Developer (that also dabbles in React Native!) who cares too much about cross-platform applications and building a decentralized future, but for now I'm just obsessed with Javascript.

I've built software for a parking company, a gas station chain, a pharmaceutical technology company, my university, private individuals and now I'm teaching others in my free-time at [Trilogy Education Services](https://www.trilogyed.com/).

I'm also on the hunt for a new full-time career move, so feel free to checkout [my portfolio](https://actuallydan.github.io) or send me an email at dankral01@gmail.com if you're looking for someone with experince in React, Node, GraphQL and serverless!
